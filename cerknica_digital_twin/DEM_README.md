## Description

This dataset contains a Very High Resolution (VHR) Digital Elevation Model (DEM)  
of the Cerknica Intermittent Lake (Slovenia), created from a UAV survey performed  
in early September 2025 during a dry phase of the lake.

The surface was mapped under dry conditions, enabling high-accuracy reconstruction  
of the lakebed and surrounding floodplain.

The DEM was generated using a photogrammetric Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and  
Multi-View Stereo (MVS) workflow, including:

- Tie-point extraction  
- Bundle adjustment  
- Dense point cloud generation  
- Interpolation  

Source imagery was acquired at a ground sampling distance (GSD) of 2–3 cm.  
The final dataset is delivered as:

- 25 cm DEM (primary product)
- Optional 1 m resampled DEM
